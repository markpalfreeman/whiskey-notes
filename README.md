# Whiskey Notes
An online book of whiskey tasting notes, inspired by [33 Books](http://www.33books.com/products/33-whiskeys).

I wanted a way to take notes on every whiskey I try in a simple, memorable format that has the fields I need.
Paper and pencil are fine, but if you're out a bar/restaurant, having something quick and easy is key, and then the digital library is there forever.
